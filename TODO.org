* Mold rules
** For each step, run diffusion and cyto plasma transfer.
   Cytoplasma cannot be solely represented with diffusion due to SUCC
   
** Cell state
   A cell is defined by its genome and its internal state
   Physically speaking a cell has a certian max amount of cytoplasm, however this can probably be 
   handled by diffusion and transfer.

** New cells
   If pressure is large enough, and cell exists at a frontier (i.e has 3 or less neighbors)
   a new cell is generated. Based on parameters such as gene size this takes some amount of
   energy in order to generate a new nuclei.
   
** Cell death
   If a cell has less than some treshhold of cytoplasma it dies. This can be caused by excessive
   SUCC from neighboring cells, less cytoplasma in general, or a sell maintaining negative SUCC.

*** Nuclei death? 
    It might be useful for a cell to commit die, replacing it with a new genome, essentially
    resetting itself.
   
** Energy and food
   As energy squares are colonized, energy as well as chemical markers will be produced.
   Energy is the currency spent for making signaling proteins, new nuclei, spores, SUCC and
   more cytoplasma 
*** Energy and cytoplasma
    generation of cytoplasma could possibly require energy and water as a second resource, either
    represented by a different square, or as a process that can only be do at cell wall squares.
    
** Cell self modification
   Should probably be aggregated, thus offloading chemical interactions to various signalling proteins.
    
* Doing
** TODO Special squares (food)
* Later
** TODO Drain resources over time
** TODO Parametrise Cell control
** TODO Add TODO items
* Maybe
** TODO Special squares (water)
* Done
** DONE Better food generation algorithm
** DONE Running simulator
*** DONE Figure out what is going on with buffer switching etc
*** DONE Make it not crash
*** DONE Instantiate init genome(s)
** DONE Improve renderer
** DONE Cell control
*** DONE Implement SMCGP for Slime mold
    How much repurposing is necessary?
    Turn Graph into abstract class maybe?

*** DONE Interface between genome and chemical gradients.
    Aka create a runGenome method

**** DONE Create genome "command" => cell state function (runGenome)
     Genome should govern how the cell spends energy to generate
     + cytoplasma
     + SUCC
     + signaling proteins
     + spores (points)?

     Its inputs should be
     + signaling proteins
     + food (possibly conveyed by signalling proteins?)
     + pressure?
   
** DONE Cell genesis
** DONE Cell death
